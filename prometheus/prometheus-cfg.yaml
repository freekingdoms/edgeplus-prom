    # A scrape configuration for running Prometheus on a Kubernetes cluster.
    # This uses separate scrape configs for cluster components (i.e. API server, node)
    # and services to allow each to use different authentication configs.
    #
    # Kubernetes labels will be added as Prometheus labels on metrics via the
    # `labelmap` relabeling action.
    #
    # If you are using Kubernetes 1.7.2 or earlier, please take note of the comments
    # for the kubernetes-cadvisor job; you will need to edit or remove this job.

    # Scrape config for API servers.
    #
    # Kubernetes exposes API servers as endpoints to the default/kubernetes
    # service so this uses `endpoints` role and uses relabelling to only keep
    # the endpoints associated with the default/kubernetes service using the
    # default named port `https`. This works for single API server deployments as
    # well as HA API server deployments.
